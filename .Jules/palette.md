## 2024-05-23 - Status Container for Process Steps
**Learning:** `st.status` provides a much better UX for multi-step processes than `st.expander` + `st.spinner`. It automatically handles the "running" state and allows for a cleaner summary upon completion (success/error/warning icons).
**Action:** Use `st.status` for all long-running operations that have sub-steps or logs, instead of manually managing expanders and placeholders.
